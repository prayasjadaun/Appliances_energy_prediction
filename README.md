# Appliances_energy_prediction
Project Overview:
For this project, I have a dataset with various columns related to energy consumption and environmental conditions. The goal of this project could be to analyze and visualize the data to gain insights into energy usage and the factors that influence it. You can explore trends, correlations, and patterns in the data to inform decision-making or predictions.

Description:
The dataset contains information related to energy consumption (Appliances and lights), temperature (T1 to T9), relative humidity (RH_1 to RH_9), weather conditions (T_out, Press_mm_hg, RH_out, Windspeed, Visibility, Tdewpoint), and two additional columns (rv1 and rv2).

Summary:
The dataset appears to capture information related to a household's energy consumption and the environmental conditions affecting it. You can conduct various data analysis and visualization tasks to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the data.

DataSet Information:
1. Columns: The dataset consists of 29 columns.
2. Date: The date and time of data collection.
3. Appliances: Energy usage in Wh (target variable for prediction).
4. Lights: Energy usage of light fixtures in the house in Wh(Watt-hour).
5. T1 to T9: Temperature in different areas of the house in Celsius.
6. RH_1 to RH_9: Relative humidity in different areas of the house.
7. T_out: Outdoor temperature.
8. Press_mm_hg: Pressure in mm Hg.
9. RH_out: Outdoor relative humidity.
10. Windspeed: Windspeed.
11. Visibility: Visibility.
12. Tdewpoint: Dew point temperature.
13. rv1: Random variable 1.
14. rv2: Random variable 2.
Attribute Information:
The columns in the dataset represent various attributes related to energy usage, environmental conditions, and time. Each attribute provides specific information that can be used for analysis and visualization.

This project offers a great opportunity to apply data analysis and visualization techniques to extract valuable insights from the dataset and make data-driven decisions.

Conclusion
Date: This column likely represents the date and time of data recording, which can be valuable for time series analysis and understanding how the other variables change over time.

Appliances: This column probably represents energy consumption by appliances. You can analyze it to understand patterns in appliance usage and its impact.

Lights: This column likely indicates energy usage for lighting. Examining it can reveal when lights are typically on or off.

T1 to T9: These columns are associated with temperature measurements in different areas or rooms (T1 is typically the kitchen, T2 is a different room, and so on). Analyzing these can help identify temperature trends in various locations.

RH_1 to RH_9: Similar to the temperature columns, these columns represent relative humidity in different areas. You can use them to study humidity variations.

T_out: This column likely represents the outdoor temperature. It's important to understand the relationship between indoor and outdoor temperatures.

Press_mm_hg: This column may indicate atmospheric pressure, which can have implications for weather-related analyses.

RH_out: Represents outdoor relative humidity, useful for weather-related insights.

Windspeed: This column is likely the wind speed, which can be informative for understanding the effects of wind on indoor conditions.

Visibility: Indicates visibility conditions and can be relevant for various analyses.

Tdewpoint: Represents the dew point temperature, which is essential for studying humidity levels.

rv1 and rv2: These columns appear to be some form of variables. Their exact meaning may require further investigation of the dataset documentation.

These conclusions provide an initial overview of the dataset columns and their potential significance in your analysis. Further exploration and data analysis will yield more insights based on your specific research or objectives.
